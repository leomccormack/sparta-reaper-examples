# AmbisonicRoomEncoding

Plug-ins used: [sparta_ambiRoomSim](https://leomccormack.github.io/sparta-site/docs/plugins/sparta-suite/#ambiroomsim), [sparta_ambiBIN](https://leomccormack.github.io/sparta-site/docs/plugins/sparta-suite/#ambibin).

The sparta_ambiRoomSim.RPP example project is configured to use the **sparta_ambiRoomSim** plugin to encode mono input signals into Ambisonic signals, along with modelling room reflections corresponding to a shoe-box shaped geometry. The simulated Ambisonic signals are then decoded to headphones using the **sparta_ambiBIN** plug-in.
