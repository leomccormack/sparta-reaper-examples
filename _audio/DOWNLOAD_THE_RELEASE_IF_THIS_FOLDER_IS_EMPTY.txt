If this folder does not contain any audio files, then please download them from here:
https://github.com/leomccormack/sparta-reaper-examples/releases

The structure should be: 
sparta-reaper-examples/_audio/Eigenmike32/
sparta-reaper-examples/_audio/FOA/
sparta-reaper-examples/_audio/test_scenes/

All of the examples then include the above folders as relative search paths.
